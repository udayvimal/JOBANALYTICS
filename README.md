## 🔥 **Sample SQL Queries**  
Here are some **sample queries** demonstrating different SQL techniques used in this project:  

### **🔹 Example 1: Find Top 10 Best-Selling Products**  
```sql
SELECT 
    product_id, 
    product_name, 
    SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales
FROM gold_fact_sales
GROUP BY product_id, product_name
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 10;
```  

### **🔹 Example 2: Customer Segmentation Based on Spending**  
```sql
WITH customer_spending AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id, 
        SUM(sales_amount) AS total_spent
    FROM gold_fact_sales
    GROUP BY customer_id
)
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    CASE 
        WHEN total_spent >= 5000 THEN 'VIP'
        WHEN total_spent BETWEEN 1000 AND 4999 THEN 'Regular'
        ELSE 'New'
    END AS customer_segment
FROM customer_spending;
```  

### **🔹 Example 3: Month-over-Month Sales Growth**  
```sql
WITH monthly_sales AS (
    SELECT 
        DATE_FORMAT(order_date, '%Y-%m') AS month, 
        SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales
    FROM gold_fact_sales
    GROUP BY month
)
SELECT 
    month,
    total_sales,
    LAG(total_sales) OVER (ORDER BY month) AS prev_month_sales,
    (total_sales - LAG(total_sales) OVER (ORDER BY month)) / 
        LAG(total_sales) OVER (ORDER BY month) * 100 AS sales_growth_pct
FROM monthly_sales;
```
